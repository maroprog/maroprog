- 👋 Hi, I’m @maroprog
- 👀 I’m interested in computer systems for mechanics (solid and fluids)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to compute aero/hydrodynamics forces on rigid solids, to simulate position and orientation of bodies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people that express mathematical formulation for that forces in order to compute on Processing/Python programs.
- 📫 How to reach me: jose.miguel@ci.ufpb.br
